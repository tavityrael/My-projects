This code represents the fifth chalange of freeCodeCamp.org from a list of five to be isued Python developer certificate after a compition of  approximately 300 hours of coursework.
TASK:
      "Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls. What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.
       For this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat."
